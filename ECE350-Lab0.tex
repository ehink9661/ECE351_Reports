\section{Questions}

1. What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?\\
Last summer I worked as a floor associate at the Home Depot and did my technical writing class to fill in the time. This summer I hope to get an internship down in Boise so that I can get industry experience (and not have to go back to home depot).\\
\\
2. What do you personally want to get out of this lab?\\
I want to work on my python skills so that I can more effectively code in it as well as model problems for easier understanding and solving.
